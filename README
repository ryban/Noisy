noisy is a small noise library I made for my own projects.

Building

There are no external depndencies to build the library itself, but to build the example you will need libpng

You do need premake to generate the makefiles. Just run premake4 gmake on OSX or Linux. For Windows you do the same but use your prefered buld build method, like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks

The output of the library will be in noise/lib as a static library.

Alternatively you can just put the source directly into your project.
